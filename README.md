# gearTracker

## The Problem
There is no worse feeling that driving to a wedding several hours away and wondering if a specific lens made it into the camera bag. While I'm always cautious, I wanted a system that allowed me to have a peaceful drive and ensured that all my gear made it into the bag. I also wanted to be able to create types of events and a gear list for each event.

## The Solution
gearTracker allows users to:
* Take an inventory of their photography gear
* Create an event (ie: Wedding, Proposal, Engagement)
* Associate certain gear with an event
* Create a photoshoot
* Pack gear for the photoshoot
* Be notified if gear is missing while packing and/or returning gear after a photoshoot

## Technologies
gearTracker is built using Python & Django and uses Django Templates
`Python 3.6.0`
`Django 1.10.5`


## Get Started
